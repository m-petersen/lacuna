# Tutorials

Welcome to the Lacuna tutorials! These learning-oriented guides will teach you how to work with Lacuna.

The tutorials are self-contained Jupyter notebooks. You can run them locally or via the Colab links provided in each tutorial.

## First steps

We recommend following these tutorials in order. They provide a high-level overview of analyses to introduce you to the package:
